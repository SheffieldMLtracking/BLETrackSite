  <h1>BLE Bee Tracking System Documentation</h1>
  <p>The BLE Bee Tracking System is a solution for landscape scale tracking of flying central place foragers. The tracked subject is tagged with a powered reciever, 
    and across the landscape rotating high gain BLE transmitters are deployed to transmit data to the reciever tag. The tag is retrived from the tracked individual
    and the data recieved is read from the tag. To keep the tag's profile and weight as low as possible, very little data is recieved by the tag. This necessitates 
    probabilistic modelling of the reciever's movement to reconstruct its path across the landscape.</p>
